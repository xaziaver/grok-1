# Branch to improve efficency of MoE layer

**Ideas**
1. Custom CUDA Kernels
 - optimized for the operations required by MoE layer
2. Efficient Routing Mechanisms
 - which experts should process each input?
 - instead of softmax function, use top-k gating or reinforcement learning-based routing
3. Sparse Computation
 - only compute the outputs of the selected experts based on the routing mechanism
4. Parallel and Distributed Computing
5. Model Compression Techniques
 - quantization, pruning


# Custom CUDA kernels
*In the context of the MoE layer, kernels can be developed to optimize:*
(1) expert selection
(2) expert computation
(3) result aggregation

Need to identify the bottlenecks from analyzing the current implementation of the MoE layer
